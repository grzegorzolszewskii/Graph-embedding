# Graph embedding

Graph embedding is one of the solutions to the shortest path problem. When graph is embedded it gets a new property - distances between graph vertices. Embedding makes it possible to find shortest the path between two vertices by using greedy routing algorithm, which is faster than BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.

The program uses math to optimize the embedding. The goal is to get the embedding with the highest greedy routing succes rate. Greedy routing succes rate determines how good the embedding is.

In this project I use popular machine learning and deep learning algorithms, implemented with PyTorch library.
